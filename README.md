## 📊 Project Description

This project explores various machine learning algorithms to detect fraud in financial transactions. Fraud detection is a critical challenge in the finance industry due to the rarity and impact of fraudulent activities. This notebook walks through a complete ML pipeline—from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

### Key Components:
- 📁 Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, created dummy variables for categorical features, and applied feature scaling.
- 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized class distribution and feature trends using bar plots, histograms, and Heatmap.
- 🤖 Model Building: Implemented four classification algorithms — Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- 🧪 Model Evaluation: Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
